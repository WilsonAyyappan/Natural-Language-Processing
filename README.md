Developed a sequence classifier prototype to label abbreviations and long forms in scientific literature using the BIO format. Conducted experiments with various preprocessing techniques, algorithms (SVM, HMM, CRF, RNN, FFNN), and text encodings (tf-idf, word2vec, GloVe). Evaluated models using F1-score, precision, recall, and ROC curves. Deployed a web service for the model, implemented performance testing, and basic monitoring.
